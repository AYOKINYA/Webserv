        -a file name youpi.bla
        -a sub directory called nop
                -a file name youpi.bad_extension in nop
                -a file name other.pouic in nop
        -a sub directory called Yeah

- /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice
- any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable
- /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
- /directory/ must answer to GET request and the root of it would be the repository YoupiBanane and if no file are requested, it should search for youpi.bad_extension files
